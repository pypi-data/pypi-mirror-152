# BulkFileChanger
This is a simple script that allows you to change or remove characters in the name of all files in a directory and its sub-directories. Example use case: say you have a bunch of files that have "test-" in front of the names of every single file in the directory. You want to change all files with that prefix to "prod-". You can use this script to make the change all in one go.
