# Multistate Epigenetic Pacemaker

## A fast conditional expectation maximization algorithm for modeling epigenetic states

The Multistate Epigenetic Pacemaker (MSEPM) is a multidimensional extension of the Epigenetic Pacemaker (EPM), 
that extends the EPM framework to model multiple epigenetic states simultaneously. 
The MSEPM is under active development.
