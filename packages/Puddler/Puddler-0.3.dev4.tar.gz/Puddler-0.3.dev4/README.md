**Latest update:**
+ reinstated printing specials within normal season, if your media server thinks it belongs there
+ `mediaserver_information.py` spaghetti code a little bit improved
+ optimized discord presence (slightly)
+ finally took the time to read the mpv manual -> window bar and title bar finally feature the correct information
+ fixed a few more small bugs

### Information:

Currently, only the most basic features (+discord presence).

But at least both emby and jellyfin are supported.

Playback using search-term and some weird playlist mode.

___

To-Do list:

+ up next (or whatever its called)
+ think of other useful features that require **0** effort to implement
