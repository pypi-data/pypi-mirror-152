# acido 0.10.14

Acido stands for **A**zure **C**ontainer **I**nstance **D**istributed **O**perations, with acido you can easily deploy container instances in Azure and distribute the workload of a particular task, for example, a port scanning task which has an input file with **x** hosts is splitted and distributed between **y** instances.

This tool is inspired by [axiom](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom) where you can just spin up hundreds of instances to perform a distributed nmap/ffuf/screenshotting scan, and then delete them after they have finished. 

Depending on your quota limit you may need to open a ticket to Azure to request container group limits increase.

### Add an alias in .bashrc / .zshrc:
    alias acido='python3 -m acido.cli'

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    -c, --config          Start configuration of acido.
    -w WAIT, --wait WAIT  Number of seconds to wait for the command to finish.
    -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                            The name of the file to split.
    -in, --interactive    Start interactive acido session.
    -sh SHELL, --shell SHELL
                            Execute command and upload to blob.
    -d DOWNLOAD_INPUT, --download DOWNLOAD_INPUT
                            Download file contents remotely from the acido blob.

### Example usage with nmap
In this example we are going to use acido to:
* Create 3 containers
* Install nmap on the containers
* Use the created containers to gather the output of an nmap scan against a list containing 6 targets.

The result of doing this, is that acido automatically splits the target file into 3 files to scan the hosts in parallel and retrieves the output of the 3 containers.

NOTE: For scans that can take longer than 1 minute, you must specify -w TIMEOUT where timeout is the number of seconds we should wait for output.

### Requirements

#### OS: Mac OS / Linux

#### Requirement 1: Install tmux
Because the commands are executed through multiplexing tmux is mandatory. The tool has only been tested on Mac OS, but should work on Linux.

#### Requirement 2: Login to Azure & Create an Azure Container Registry
    $ az login
    $ az acr create --resource-group Merabytes \
    --name merabytes --sku Basic

#### Requirement 3: Install acido and configure your RG & Registry
    pip install acido
    python3 -m acido.cli -c
    $ acido -c
    [+] Selecting I/O storage account (acido).
    [!] Please provide a Resource Group Name to deploy the ACIs: Merabytes
    [!] Image Registry Server: merabytes.azurecr.io
    [!] Image Registry Username: merabytes
    [!] Image Registry Password: *********
    $

#### Requirement 4: Monkey Patching Azure CLI to use az container exec
In order for the tool to work properly, you need to monkey-patch a bug inside **az container exec** command in the sys.stdout.write function.

File: /lib/python3.9/site-packages/azure/cli/command_modules/container/custom.py

Line: 684

    def _cycle_exec_pipe(ws):
        r, _, _ = select.select([ws.sock, sys.stdin], [], [])
        if ws.sock in r:
            data = ws.recv()
            sys.stdout.write(data.decode() if isinstance(data, bytes) else data) # MODIFY THE LINE LIKE THIS
            sys.stdout.flush()
        if sys.stdin in r:
            x = sys.stdin.read(1)
            if not x:
                return True
            ws.send(x)
        return True
