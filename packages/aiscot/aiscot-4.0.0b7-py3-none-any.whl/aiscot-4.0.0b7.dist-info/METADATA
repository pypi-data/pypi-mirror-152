aiscot receives AIS Sentences from an AIS Receiver, such as ais-decoder,
converts them to Cursor-on-Target Events, and transmits the CoT Events to a destination.

For use with CoT systems such as ATAK, WinTAK, etc. See https://www.civtak.org/ for more information on the TAK
program.

Utilized for an open ocean boat race in the Northern Pacific Ocean, as
described in this article: http://ampledata.org/boat_race_support.html
