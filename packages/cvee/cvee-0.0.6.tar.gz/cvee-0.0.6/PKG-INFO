# cvee

A set of tools for CV researchers.

## Installation

We aim to limit our dependencies to the following libraries (which should be quite common):

```
torch
numpy
opencv2
matplotlib
pyyaml
rich
```

And following libraries should be optional:

```
trimesh (for geometry process)
open3d  (for 3d visualization)
```

### Install locally

```bash
pip install -e .
```
