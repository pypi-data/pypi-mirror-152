# Task 1 - Create a 3×3 numpy array of all Trues.

# Task 2 - Create an array and replace all odd numbers in arr with 32.

# Task 3 - Create the following patterns without hardcoding: 
# First - [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
# Second - [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
arr = np.array([1,2,3])

# Task 4 - Get all items between 5 and 10 from the given array. 
a = np.array([2, 6, 1, 9, 10, 3, 27])

# Task 5 - Get the common items between a and b:
a = np.array([1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5,6])
b = np.array([7,2,10,2,7,4,9,4,9,8])

# Task 6 - Create a 2D array of shape 5×3 to contain random decimal numbers between 5 and 10.

# Task 7 - Output the transpose of a matrix (as numpy array)
a = np.array([[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]])

# Task 8 - Find non - zero elements and indices of them from the given array.
arr = np.array([1,2,0,0,4,0])

# Task 9 - Create a 4x5 array with random integer values and find the indices of the minimum and maximum values.

# Task 10 - Create an array, negate all elements which are between 3 and 8, in place.
