# Introduction
## Goals of this project
This project doesn’t do anything useful. It exists only as a vehicle to demonstrate:
*  how to prepare a Python project that can be uploaded to the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) as a release, from which it can then be installed on user systems using
the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package installer—using *static* metadata (`setup.cfg`) rather than dynamic
metadata (`setup.py`)
*  how static text files (for example, templates, sample data, etc.) can be packaged and then—using
`importlib.resources`—referenced and read from their host package or any other package, even if these files don’t
actually reside on the file system (e.g., if they reside in a .zip archive). This is relevant because:
    * [“[T]he PyPA recommends that any data files you wish to be accessible at run time be included **inside the package**.”](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html#non-package-data-files)
    * [PEP 302](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) added hooks to import from .zip files and Python Eggs.
* use of a `src/` directory intermediate between the project directory and the outermost package directory—with multiple
benefits
* how to provide a single source for the version number, in this case by supplying a `__version__.py` file in the import
module that is (a) imported by `__init__.py` and (b) referenced by `setup.cfg`
* how to specify third-party dependencies that are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) so that `pip` will install
them as well, if necessary, when `pip` installs  this project
* how to tell the `build` mechanism to identify a specific version of Python, e.g., `py39`, in the “Python Tag” in
the file name of the resulting “wheel” (`.whl`) distribution file, so that users will be better informed of the
Python-version requirement before attempting to install the package
* how to use a `__main__.py` file as an entry point, which will execute when the import package is invoked on
the command line with the `-m` flag (e.g., `python -m my_package`)
* how to define a console-script entry point, e.g., `my-command`, so that the user can simply and directly invoke
`my-command` on the command line, rather than `python -m my_package`
* how to provide for, and process, an optional argument on the command line
* how to reference, from outside the package, modules, methods, function, etc. that are within the package, in order to, 
for example, to test them
*  how to install the project in “editable”/“development” mode during development so that you can test the
functionalities that access resources in packages—without having to rebuild and reinstall the package after every change.

In addition to reading this README, it will probably be useful to complement this README with inspection of the files 
themselves. You can examine the configurations and code directly for a given file by accessing it at  the
[file list](https://github.com/jimratliff/python-demo-package-sample-data-with-code/find/main) for the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jimratliff/python-demo-package-sample-data-with-code). You could also download or clone the repository and use it as a template for a new project.

All citations/quotations to documentation and other sources were valid as of May 1, 2022.

## Dependencies
***NOTE: This package requires Python 3.9+.*** This package has been tested only on Python 3.9.12, with pip 22.1.1,
on a Mac (macOS 12.3.1). 

This package also requires [yachalk](https://pypi.org/project/yachalk/). If you install this project (demo-package-sample-data-with-code) as explained later, `pip` should automatically install `yachalk` if it is not 
already installed on your system. `yachalk` allows console output to be rendered in specified colors. Here, I use it to
make error messages red. I incorporated `yachalk` into the code largely to provide an excuse to illustrate how to
disclose in the metadata the existence of a third-party dependency that also may need to be installed by `pip`.

## Terminology
For my use of “project” and “package” (including “import package” and “distribution package”) see Jim Ratliff,
“[Unpacking ‘package’ terminology in Python](https://gist.github.com/jimratliff/fc799e74e8104e6b05e6894ce8555144),”
GitHub Gist.

In particular, I very deliberately choose:
* to use hyphens to separate the words in the *project* name: `demo-package-sample-data-with-code`
  * I also use hyphens in the console-scripts entry-point command: `my-command` that the user can type on the command
  line in lieu of the [runpy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html) syntax:
  `python -m demo_package_sample_data_with_code`
* to use underscores to separate the words in the import package name: `demo_package_sample_data_with_code` as well as
every other directory below that level.

This isn’t a gratuitous attempt to confuse the reader but rather in the spirit of
“[Explicit is better than implicit.](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)” In practice, the project name and import
package name are often chosen to be the same. It then is ambiguous in many discussion whether that common name is
invoked in any particular case (a) because it is the project name or (b) because it is the import package name. My
distinguishing the two is meant to help clarify what drives various behaviors. (See also § [Considerations regarding the inter-word delimiter character in a multiword project name](#considerations-regarding-the-inter-word-delimiter-character-in-a-multiword-project-name).)

## Resources for topics not well covered here
I will not go into a detailed explanation of many aspects of packaging more generally that are well covered
elsewhere, e.g., the `LICENSE`,  `README`, `pyproject.toml`, and `setup.cfg` files (or why I’m
using `setup.cfg` rather than `setup.py`). For these and other such topics, see for example:

[Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/), and in particular

    * § [Configuring metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects#configuring-metadata).

I’m also not going to address here any issues about testing, as important as they are.

## Problem considered: Reliably accessing resources included in the package
Instead, I focus here on the particular problem, as
[explained by Barry Warsaw at PyCon US 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsGFU2qh73E):
> Resources are files that live within Python packages. Think test data files, certificates, templates, translation
catalogs, and other static files you want to access from Python code. Sometimes you put these static files in a package
directory within your source tree, and then locate them by importing the package and using its `__file__` attribute. But
this doesn’t work for zip files! 

The previous standard method, `pkg_resources`, is not a great solution:
> You could use `pkg_resources`, an API that comes with `setuptools` and hides the differences between files on the file
system and files in a zip file. This is great because you don't have to use` __file__`, but it’s not so great because
`pkg_resources` is a big library and can have potentially severe performance problems, even at import time. … 

>The biggest problem with `pkg_resources` is that it has import-time side effects. Even if you’re never going to access
your sample data, you’re paying the cost of it because as soon as you import `pkg_resources` you pay this penalty. …
`pkg_resources` crawls over every entry in your `sys.path` and it builds up these working sets and does all this runtime 
work. … If you have a lot of things on your `sys.path`, this can be very, very slow. … 

The better solution is:
> Welcome to `importlib.resources`, a new module and API in Python 3.7 that is also available as a standalone library
for older versions of Python. `importlib.resources` is built on top of Python’s existing import system, so it is very
efficient. 

See also §§ [Accessing Data Files at Runtime](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html#accessing-data-files-at-runtime)
of § [Data Files Support](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html) of
[Building and Distributing Packages with Setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/index.html) by PyPA:
>Typically, existing programs manipulate a package’s `__file__` attribute in order to find the location of data files.
However, this manipulation isn’t compatible with PEP 302-based import hooks, including importing from zip files and
Python Eggs. It is strongly recommended that, if you are using data files, you should use `importlib.resources` to
access them. 

The following sources explicitly discuss using `importlib.resources` to access resources integrated within a package:
* Barry Warsaw, “Get your resources faster, with `importlib.resources`,”  PyCon US 2018.
([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsGFU2qh73E), [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018/barry-warsaw-get-your-resources-faster-with-importlib-dot-resources))
* James Briggs, “How to Build Python Packages for Pip,” YouTube » James Briggs, April 2, 2021.

* Damien Martin, “[Making a Python Package](https://kiwidamien.github.io/making-a-python-package.html),”
GitHub » kiwidamien. See especially
“[Making a Python Package VI: including data files](https://kiwidamien.github.io/making-a-python-package.html).”

If the advent of `importlib.resources` in Python 3.7 weren’t enough, an additional function, viz., `files()`, was added
in Python 3.9. I rely upon the `files()` function in this package, and for that reason this package requires
Python 3.9.

        * finishing your development in a local “editable” or “development” install,
        * building your project and turning it into a distribution package that can be uploaded to PyPI,
        * uploading it to TestPyPI, 
        * testing your distribution by created a new virtual environment and installing your project from TestPyPI.

# `importlib.resources`: Selected basics
## Background
[`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html), a Python built-in library, appeared in Python 3.1 and
provides the Python 3 implementation of the `import` statement.

Within `importlib`, the module
[`importlib.resources`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources) was added in
Python 3.7:
> This module leverages Python’s import system to provide access to resources within packages. If you can import a
package, you can access resources within that package. Resources can be opened or read, in either binary or text mode.
>
>Resources are roughly akin to files inside directories, though it’s important to keep in mind that this is just a
metaphor. Resources and packages do not have to exist as physical files and directories on the file system.

(Note that the
[documentation for `importlib.resources`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources)
actually refers readers to the
[documentation for `importlib_resources`](https://importlib-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html), which is the
standalone backport of `importlib.resources` for earlier versions of Python, for more information on using
`importlib.resources`.)
## The `files()` function
This demo package calls the
[function `importlib.resources.files(`*`package`*`)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.resources.files),
where *`package`* can be either a name or a module object that conforms to the `Package` requirements. The function
returns an instance of abstract base class `importlib.abc.Traversable`. This object has available a subset of
`pathlib.Path` methods suitable for traversing directories and opening files:
* `joinpath(`*child*`)`
* `__truediv__(`*child*`)`
* `name()`
* `is_dir()`
* `is_file()`
* `iterdir()`
* `open(`*mode*`='r',`*\*args*`,`*\*\*kwargs*`)`
* `read_bytes()`
* `read_text(`*encoding=None*`)`

You can specify the location of a resource from (a) the name of the package immediately enclosing the resource and
(b) the name of the resource  by either:

```my_resource_location_as_string = importlib.resources.files('mypackage').joinpath('resource_name')```

or

```my_resource_location_as_string = importlib.resources.files('mypackage') / 'resource_name'```

where the latter corresponds to `__truediv__(`*child*`)` method.

To read the text into a variable:

```text_in_file = my_resource_location_as_string.read_text()```

# This project
## File and directory structure; rationale for `src/` directory
This project has the following initial directory/file structure:
```
├── LICENSE
├── MANIFEST.in
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
├── docs
├── src
│   ├── demo_package_and_read_data_files
│   │   ├── sample_data
│   │   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   │   └── sample_data_e.txt
│   │   └── sample_data_pi.txt
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── __main__.py
│   │   ├── __version__.py
│   │   ├── constants.py
│   │   ├── my_module.py
└── tests
    └── test_my_module.py
```
By “initial directory/file structure,” I acknowledge that additional directories will be generated as a result of
(a) creating a virtual environment, which adds a `venv/` directory, (b) installing the project in an
“editable”/“development” mode, which adds a `src/demo_package_sample_data_with_code.egg-info` directory, and
(c) the `build` process, which adds a `dist/` directory. 

### Key user-facing names
| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|demo-package-sample-data-with-code | The *project* name, as it appears on PyPI and in a `pip install` |
|python-demo-package-sample-data-with-code | Name of [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jimratliff/python-demo-package-sample-data-with-code). Independent of any other name|
|demo_package_sample_data_with_code | Name of the import package |
|my_module.py | Name of the primary module of Python code|

### The `src/` directory structure
Note the presence of the `src/` directory at the root level of the project directory and which contains the import 
package `demo_package_and_read_data_files`. This structure—the presence of this `src/` directory—is certainly not yet a
standard but is gaining mindshare. I won’t attempt to justify it myself here, but instead I’ll point you to the
following resources:
* § “[A simple project](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#a-simple-project)” in
PyPA’s tutorial “[Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects)”
* From [Building and Distributing Packages with Setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/index.html),
PyPA
  * §§ “[Using a `src/` layout](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html#using-a-src-layout)

  § “[Automatic discovery](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html#automatic-discovery)”
> This layout is very handy when you wish to use automatic discovery, since you don’t have to worry about other Python
files or folders in your project root being distributed by mistake. In some circumstances it can be also less
error-prone for testing or when using PEP 420-style packages. On the other hand you cannot rely on the implicit
PYTHONPATH=. to fire up the Python REPL and play with your package (you will need an editable install to be able to do
that).

2019.
    * E.g., the `src/` structure (a) ensures that you test your code from the same working directory that your users
    will see when they install your package, (b) allows simpler packaging code and a simpler `MANIFEST.in`, and
    (c) results in a much cleaner editable install.
* Mark Smith’s presentation at EuroPython 2019: “Publishing (Perfect) Python Packages on PyPi”
([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIF3LaRqgXo) at
[26:00](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxfbdPcyxLVokUw4w9ug1bhAAqCIeLSA8v),
[GitHub](https://github.com/judy2k/publishing_python_packages_talk)):
    * “Here’s why we use the `src/` directory. Our root directory is the directory we’ve been working in. If our code
    was inthis directory—if we import `helloworld` while running the tests—it would run the code in our current
    directory. But we don’t want it to do that. We want it to test installing the package and using the code from there.
    By having the `src/` directory, you’re forcing it to use the version you’ve just installed into the versioned
    environment.”

## Noncomprehensive comments on selected elements of the project metadata and structure
### The directory that immediately encloses each resource must be a package and thus must have an `__init__.py` file
`importlib.resources` considers a file a resource only if the file is in the root directory of a package. A directory
cannot be a package unless it includes a `__init__.py` file. (It’s fine if this `__init__.py` file is empty. It’s its
filename that counts.)

Here the relevant resources are two text files:
* "sample_data_pi.txt"
    * located at the root of the import package, i.e.,
    * src/demo_package_and_read_data_files/sample_data_pi.txt
* "sample_data_e.txt"
    * located within a subfolder, "sample_data", of the import package, i.e.,
    * src/demo_package_and_read_data_files/sample_data/sample_data_e.txt

(Soley to demonstrate throwing a `FileNotFoundError` exception, `my_module.py` also attempts to open
`meaning_of_life.txt`, but, unsurprisingly, it does not exist.)

In our case the requirement that each data file be in the root directory of a package  means that the following
directories each must have an `__init__.py` file:
*  `src/demo_package_and_read_data_files`
    * This directory would have been a package (and thus would have had an `__init__.py` file) even if we had no data
    files to worry about, so no additional `__init__.py` file is created for this directory on account of the data
    files.
*  `src/demo_package_and_read_data_files/sample_data`
    * This directory is *not* a directory of Python files, so it would not normally have an `__init__.py` file. Thus,
    in order to read the data file from inside, we need to artificially add an `__init__.py` file inside.
### Telling `setuptools` about data files that need to be included in the package
`setuptools` will not by default incorporate arbitrary non-Python text files into the package when it builds it. Thus,
you must tell `setuptools` which such files you want it to include.

In the methodology I use here, this requires:
* telling the configuration file `setup.cfg` that you *do* have such files to be included, but not there saying which
ones
* creating a `MANIFEST.in` file that specifies the data files (including their paths) to be included.

(If you’re using a different methodology, like using `setup.py` rather than `setup.cfg`, see the corresponding
discussion at § [Data File Support](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html#) of the
[Setuptools User Guide](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/index.html).)

#### `setup.cfg`: `include_package_data`
In the configuration file `setup.cfg`, in its `[options]` section, specify:
`include_package_data = True`
#### Create `MANIFEST.in` and itemize the data files
See, generally:
§ “[Including files in source distributions with `MANIFEST.in`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/#)”
of “[Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/).” 

In the present case, the `MANIFEST.in` file contains the following and only the following:
```
include src/demo_package_sample_data_with_code/sample_data_pi.txt
graft src/demo_package_sample_data_with_code/sample_data
```
where `graft` ensures, without itemizing them, that all data files in `/sample_data` are included. (See
§ [`MANIFEST.in` commands](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/#manifest-in-commands) in the
Python Packaging User Guide.)

Thanks to the structure adopted here, where the `src/` directory separates all the project metadata from the project
code/data, the  `MANIFEST.in` perhaps could be made even simpler:
```
graft src
```
which would ensure that all files within `src/` are included in the distribution.
(See [Ionel Cristian Mărieș](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure): “Without `src`
writting a `MANIFEST.in` is tricky. … It’s much easier with a `src` directory: just add `graft src` in `MANIFEST.in`.)
### Establishing a single source for the version number ###
This project defines its version number consistent with a frequently expressed desideratum referred to as
“[single-sourcing the package version](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/)”.

This requires coordination between three files: (a) `setup.cfg`, (b) `__init__.py`, and (c) `__version__.py`, as
described below.

For further discussion on this topic, see the answers to “[Set `__version__` of module from a file when configuring
setuptools using `setup.cfg` without `setup.py`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72357031/set-version-of-module-from-a-file-when-configuring-setuptools-using-setup),” Stack Overflow, May 23, 2022.

#### Specify the version number in the `__version__.py` file ####
The version number is defined in the `__version__.py` file within the root of import package, i.e., at path:
```
/path/to/demo-package-sample-data-with-code/src/demo_package_sample_data_with_code/__version__.py
```
with the syntax:
```
__version__ = '1.0.0'
```
This must be coupled with both an `import` in the `__init__.py` file and the appropriate directive in the `setup.cfg`
file.
#### The `__init__.py` file must import the `__version__` attribute ####
The `__init__.py` file, also within the root of the import package, i.e., at path:
```
/path/to/demo-package-sample-data-with-code/src/demo_package_sample_data_with_code/__init__.py
```
must include the following `import` command:
```
from . __version__ import __version__
```
This import statement is discussed in detail at https://stackoverflow.com/a/72357032/8401379
#### The `setup.cfg` file’s `version` declaration  must be properly defined to use the `attr:` special directive
The `setup.cfg` file, in the root of the project directory, i.e., at the path
```
/path/to/demo-package-sample-data-with-code/setup.cfg
```
must include the following snippet:
```
[metadata]
  …
version = attr: demo_package_sample_data_with_code.__version__
```
### Disclose any third-party dependencies that are available on PyPI so that they will also be installed if needed
In the `[options]` section of `setup.cfg`, I disclose the dependency on `yachalk` with the following snippet:
```
install_requires = 
    yachalk
```
See “[Configuring setuptools using setup.cfg files](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/declarative_config.html)”
of the SetupTools User Guide for more detail.
### `setup.cfg`: Add a `python-tag` tag to force file name of resulting “wheel” distribution file to reflect partticular minimum version of Python
This discussion will make more sense after you get to the later section § “[The wheel file](#the-wheel-file),” but this
discussion nevertheless logically belongs here.

This package requires Python 3.9. My `setup.cfg` file originally contained the following excerpt:
```
classifiers =
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3
    License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License
    Operating System :: OS Independent

[options]
package_dir =
    = src
packages = find:
python_requires = >=3.9
include_package_data = True
```
However, notwithstanding the `python_requires = >=3.9`, the resulting wheel file’s filename contained a “Python Tag” 
that was simply `py3` rather than `py39` (which would have indicated a minimum Python version of 3.9).

So I next changed the `Python` tag in the `Classifiers` section to explicitly state version 3.9. However, that did not
affect the Python Tag in the file name of the resulting wheel file.

I finally—inspired by [this answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52613394/8401379)—solved the problem
by adding the following section to `setup.cfg`:
```
[bdist_wheel]
python-tag = py39
```
After this change, the file name of the resulting wheel file including the Python Tag string `py39` as I desired.

### Considerations regarding the inter-word delimiter character in a multiword project name
The `name` field in `setup.cfg` (or `setup.py`) defines the name of your *project* as it will appear on PyPI. ([Examples
will often misleadingly suggest](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html) that this is
the *package* name, in some incompletely specified notion of “package,” but the only effect of this field is to
determine the *project* name on PyPI.)

When, for better readability, you want your project name to have multiple words, you need to have a nonspace delimiter
between these words. However, no matter what delimiter you prefer, e.g., underscore (`_`), hyphen (`-`), or dot (`.`),
PyPI will ignore your expressed intention and “[normalize](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/#normalized-names)” the name
so that each such delimiter (or even runs of delimiters) is replaced with a single hyphen. So, to avoid confusion, I
suggest that, when the project name has two or more words joined by delimiters, you specify hyphens for the delimiter
from the get go, since that’s the form it will ultimately take.

Of course, you might want the *import package* of your project to have the same name as your project; that’s common.
But if your project has multiple words separted by delimiters, this won’t be exactly possible. The best you could do is
name your import package the same as the project, but substituting an underscore for each delimiter. E.g.,
* Project name: `my-cool-thing`
* Import package name: `my_cool_thing`

### `__main__.py` is executed when package invoked from command line with `-m` flag; allows for a CLI
Although not appropriate in all cases, including a `__main__.py` file establishes an entry point for the case where
the package name is invoked directly (using [runpy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html)) from the command line
with the `-m` flag, e.g.,:
```
python -m demo_package_and_read_data_files
```
(Note that the import package name, `demo_package_and_read_data_files` must use underscores as the inter-word delimiter,
even though the project name uses hyphens for the delimiter.)

(In general, the `-m` flag
[tells Python to search `sys.path` for the named module and execute its contents as the `__main__` module](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m). Since the argument is a module name, you must not give a file extension (.py). What’s
crucial for us here is that package names (including namespace packages) are also permitted. When a package name is
supplied instead of a normal module, the interpreter will execute `<pkg>.__main__` as the main module.)

Thus the user can simply reference the package rather than a particular module within the package.

This can also be combined with reading additional arguments entered on the command line.

See § “[`__main__.py` in Python Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#main-py-in-python-packages)”
in “[`__main__` — Top-level code environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html),” docs.python.org.

Note that
[the contents of `__main__.py` typically aren’t fenced with `if __name__ == '__main__'` blocks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#id1).

Loosely, `__main__.py` is to a package what a `main()` function is to a console script. (E.g.,
“[main functions are often used to create command-line tools by specifying them as entry points for console scripts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#packaging-considerations).”)

## Establish a console-script entry-point command for a user to execute the program
Adding a console script entry point allows the package to define a user-friendly name for installers of the package to
execute. See § “[Entry Points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points)” of
[Building and Distributing Packages with Setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/index.html), PyPA.

To implement such a user-friendly command name, here `my-command`, we need to make modifications to (a) `setup.cfg` and
(b) `__init__.py`.
### In `setup.cfg`
```
[options.entry_points]
console_scripts =
    my-command = demo_package_sample_data_with_code.__main__:main
```
### In `__init__.py`
```
# The following import was apparently required to get the  console script
# entry point to work. Without this import, I got errors at run time (when
# issuing the command `demo-command` on the command line, but not when using
# `runpy`, i.e., `python -m`):
#    AttributeError: module 'demo_package_sample_data_with_code' has no attribute 'main'
# Thus by importing main() in __init__.py, `main` was in the proper namespace.

from . __main__ import main
```

## Allow for the user to optionally enter an argument on the command line
As an illustration of the functionality, the code uses the built-in
[argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module allows the user to (optionally) enter an argument on
the command line on the same line as the command to run the program. (Also see Tshepang Lekhonkhobe’s
[excellent `argparse` tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html).)

You can see how this functionality is implemented in this project in the `check_CLI_for_user_input()` function, which is
called from `main()`, both in `my_module.py`.

## Accessing the package’s modules, functions, etc. from outside the package
In the file and directory structure diagram above, you’ll see in the root of the project directory the module
`tests/test_my_module.py`. This is outside the scope of the code that will be installed by `pip`, which is limited to
the `src/` directory. The `tests` directory is in the standard location for the “`src`” directory/file structure that 
is adopted here (though there is also a popular train of thought that tests should be distributed within the source
directory). (See, e.g., “[Where to Put Tests?](http://pythonchb.github.io/PythonTopics/where_to_put_tests.html)”: “In Python packaging, there is no consensus on where you should put your
test suite.”)

The module `test_my_module.py` is included to illustrate how a module in this location outside of the installed 
package can reference entities within the installed package. This can be seen in the two `import` statements in
`test_my_module.py`:
```
from demo_package_sample_data_with_code.my_module import print_value_from_resource
import demo_package_sample_data_with_code.constants as source
```
# Finish development and upload to PyPI
Here I walk through—stage by stage, and command by command—the process of:
* creating a virtual environment,
* finishing your development in a local “editable” or “development” install,
* building your project and turning it into a distribution package that can be uploaded to PyPI,
* uploading it to TestPyPI, 
* testing your distribution by created a new virtual environment and installing your project from TestPyPI.


A full transcript (where only some of the output is condensed) of this process is available at:
[docs/Transcript_of_installation_and_testing.txt](https://github.com/jimratliff/python-demo-package-sample-data-with-code/blob/main/docs/Transcript_of_installation_and_testing.txt).

## Create a virtual environment
From here on, I’m assuming that you’re using a virtual environment. I use
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), noting that, per the Python Packaging User Guide
(§ “[Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)”):
“If you are using Python 3.3 or newer, the `venv` module is the preferred way to create and manage virtual
environments.”

Generally, see:
* [§ 12. Virtual Environments and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) of Python Docs.
* Brett Cannon, “[A quick-and-dirty guide on how to install packages for Python](https://snarky.ca/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-on-how-to-install-packages-for-python/),” *Tall, Snarky Canadian*, January 21, 2020. Though not
signaled by its title, there is substantial discussion of the why and how of using a virtual environment.

## Install the project in “editable mode”/“development mode” in order to test and further develop it
When still developing the package, and before ever publishing it to PyPI (or even TestPyPI), we want to install the
package from the local source (and therefore *not* from PyPI). Moreover, we do so in “editable mode,” which is
essentially “[setuptools develop mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html).” In this
mode, you continue to work on the code without needing to rebuild and reinstall the project every time you make a
change.

(See generally § “[Local project installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/)” in the
[`pip` documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/), and in particular
§§ “[Editable installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs).”)

To install this package in “editable mode”/“development mode,” we use `pip install` with the `-e` option:
```
python -m pip install -e path/to/SomeProject
```
(See “[‘Editable’ Installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs)” in the
[`pip` » commands » `install` documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#).) (Also, here’s
[an argument by Brett Cannon for using `python -m pip install -e .` instead of ` pip install -e .`](https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/).)

As the [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs) well explains:
> Editable installs allow you to install your project without copying any files. Instead, the files in the development
directory are added to Python’s import path. This approach is well suited for development and is also known as a
“development installation”.
>
> With an editable install, you only need to perform a re-installation if you change the project metadata (eg: version,
what scripts need to be generated etc). You will still need to run build commands when you need to perform a compilation
for non-Python code in the project (eg: C extensions).

For example, to navigate to the project directory, create and activate a virtual environment, and install the project
in editable mode:
```
% cd path/to/demo_package_and_read_data_files
% python3 -m venv venv
% source venv/bin/activate
% python -m pip install --upgrade pip
% python -m pip install -e .
```
(In the `pip` command the “.” in `pip install -e .` represents the path to the project.) 

Installing in editable mode allows you to edit the code and immediately see the changes without having to rebuild and
reinstall the package.

## Build the distribution package to upload to PyPI
When development matures to the point of having a version of the project you want to distribute via PyPI, the next step
is to generate a [distribution package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) for
the project.

### Install `build`
The first step is to install [`build`](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) into your virtual
environment (or upgrade if it already exists there) with
```
% python -m pip install --upgrade build
```

### Build the distribution
See
§ “[Generating distribution archives](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives)
of “[Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/),” Python
Packaging User Guide » Tutorials.
```
% cd path/to/demo_package_and_read_data_files
```

If this is your first time building distribution files for this project, continue immediately with the next step.
However, if you’ve already built distribution files for earlier versions of this project, you might already have a
`dist` directory at `path/to/my-project/dist`. In that case, move any of those earlier distribution files out of that
directory. Otherwise, later steps will cause you to re-upload them to TestPyPI/PyPI, which you don’t want.
```
% python -m build
```

This generates a fair amount of output and creates a `dist` directory at the project root, which now contains the 
following two files:
```
demo_package_sample_data_with_code-0.0.1-py39-none-any.whl
demo-package-sample-data-with-code-0.0.1.tar.gz
```
(If you didn’t already, be sure to remove older versions of the distribution files from this directory. Otherwise, later
steps will cause you to re-upload those obsolete files to TestPyPI/PyPI, which can cause an error.)
#### The wheel file
The first of these, with the `.whl` extension is a “wheel” file, or
“[built distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Built-Distribution).” It contains files
and metadata that need only to be moved to an appropriate location on the target system in order to be installed.

To better understand the file name of the wheel file (and in particular the
[platform compatibility tags](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/) after
the version number), see
§ “[File name convention](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/#file-name-convention)” of
[PEP 427 – The Wheel Binary Package Format 1.0](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/#file-name-convention), supplemented
by [PEP 425 – Compatibility Tags for Built Distributions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0425/). See also Brett Cannon,
“[The challenges in designing a library for PEP 425 (aka wheel tags)](https://snarky.ca/the-challenges-in-designing-a-library-for-pep-425/),” *Tall, Snarky Canadian*, June 1, 2019.

In the present case:
* `py39`: (“Python Tag”) Iindicates that the package requires Python 3.9.
* `none`: (“ABI Tag,” referring to
[Application Binary Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)) Indicates which Python ABI
is required by any included extension modules. `none`
“[represent[s] the case of not caring. This is typically seen with py interpreter tags since you shouldn't care about what ABI an interpreter supports if you're targeting just the Python language and not a specific interpreter](https://snarky.ca/the-challenges-in-designing-a-library-for-pep-425/).”
* `any`: (“Platform Tag”) 
#### The source archive
The second of these, with the `tar.gz` extension, is a
“[source archive](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Source-Archive),” that contains raw source code.

You should always upload a source archive and provide built archives for the platforms your project is compatible with.
In this case, our example package is compatible with Python on any platform so only one built distribution is needed.

## Upload the distribution and then install it from scratch to test it
### Install `twine`
Twine ([project on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/twine/), [docs](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) is a utility
for publishing Python packages to PyPI and other repositories. Twine is the method adopted here to upload the
built distribution files to both TestPyPI and PyPI. (See also [Uploading the distribution archives](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives) in the Python Packaging User Guide.)

To install `twine`:
```
% pip install --upgrade twine
```
### `check` your `dist/*` with `twine`
```
% twine check dist/*
Checking dist/demo_package_and_read_data_files-0.0.1-py39-none-any.whl: PASSED
Checking dist/demo_package_and_read_data_files-0.0.1.tar.gz: PASSED
```
### Test your entire distribution work flow with TestPyPI
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) is a separate Python package index that allows you to “dry run” your packaging
procedures to make sure everything works before uploading it to the main PyPI. See [Using TestPyPI](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/) in the Python Packaging User Guide.
#### Upload to test.pypi.org
See “[Using TestPyPI](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/#using-test-pypi),” of the Python
Packaging User Guide, PyPA.

```
% twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

#### Test install the package locally from TestPyPI
When visiting the above link, the page displays a command for installing the package:
```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ demo-package-and-read-data-files==0.0.1
```

##### Create a new directory and corresponding new virtual environment

```
% cd GitHub_repos 
% mkdir test_package
% python3 -m venv venv
% source venv/bin/activate
% python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
##### Install package from TestPyPI
###### When there are no third-party dependencies that must be installed from PyPI
When your project has no third-party dependencies (or all of the third-party are on TestPyPI, an unlikely occurrence
because TestPyPI regularly prunes itself) 

```
% pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ demo-package-and-read-data-files==0.0.1
```
###### When there *are* third-party dependencies that must be installed from PyPI
When there are third-party dependencies that are not available on TestPyPI but are available on
PyPI, you need to tell `pip` to also look on PyPI. (See “[Using TestPyPI](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/#using-test-pypi),” of the Python
Packaging User Guide, PyPA.)

```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ my-project
```
Note that here you aren’t disclosing which dependency to get where but rather: if `pip` can’t find a dependency on
TestPyPI, `pip` should then look on PyPI.
