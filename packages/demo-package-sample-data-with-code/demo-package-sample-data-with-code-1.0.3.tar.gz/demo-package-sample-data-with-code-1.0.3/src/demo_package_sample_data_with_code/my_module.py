    # scripts. When this is done, pip inserts the function call into a template script, where the return value of `main`
    # is passed into `sys.exit()`, which expects a return value. By proactively specifying this return value, the
    # module will have the same behavior when run directly (i.e., `python my_module.py`) as it will as a console script
    # entry point in a pip-installable package.)
    # (That said, even without this, I can't run my_module.py directly, because it chokes on the import statement
    # `from . my_module import main` with the error message:
    #    ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
    # So, this return statement may not have an actual benefit, but it certainly does no harm either.
