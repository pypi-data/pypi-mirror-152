"""This module contains all event ids and callback functions used in the experiment pipeline.

Constants:

    ON_BEGIN_EXPERIMENT_PIPELINE: id of the event that is used when the experiment pipeline starts.
    ON_END_EXPERIMENT_PIPELINE: id of the event that is used when the experiment pipeline ends.
    ON_BEGIN_THREAD_EXPERIMENT: id of the event that is used when the experiment thread starts.
    ON_END_THREAD_EXPERIMENT: id of the event that is used when the experiment thread ends.

Functions:

    get_experiment_events: get experiment pipeline events.
    on_begin_experiment_pipeline: call when the experiment pipeline starts.
    on_end_experiment_pipeline: call when the experiment pipeline ends.
    on_begin_experiment_thread: call when the experiment thread starts.
    on_end_experiment_thread: call when the experiment thread ends.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
