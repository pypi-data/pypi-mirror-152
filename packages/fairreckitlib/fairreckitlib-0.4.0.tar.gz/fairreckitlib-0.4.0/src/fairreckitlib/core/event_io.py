"""This module contains all event ids and callback functions that are IO related.

Constants:

    ON_MAKE_DIR: id of the event that is used when a directory is created.
    ON_REMOVE_DIR: id of the event that is used when a directory is removed.
    ON_REMOVE_FILE: id of the event that is used when a file is removed.
    ON_RENAME_FILE: id of the event that is used when a file is renamed.

Functions:

    on_make_dir: call when a directory is created.
    on_remove_dir: call when a directory is removed.
    on_remove_file: call when a file is removed.
    on_rename_file: call when a file is renamed.
