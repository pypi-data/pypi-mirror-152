    ON_BEGIN_TRAIN_MODEL: id of the event that is used when training a model started.
    ON_BEGIN_MODEL: id of the event that is used when a model computation started.
    ON_END_LOAD_TEST_SET: id of the event that is used when a test set has been loaded.
    ON_END_LOAD_TRAIN_SET: id of the event that is used when a train set has been loaded.
    ON_END_MODEL_PIPELINE: id of the event that is used when the model pipeline ends.
    ON_END_TEST_MODEL: id of the event that is used when testing a model finishes.
    ON_END_TRAIN_MODEL: id of the event that is used when training a model finishes.
    ON_END_MODE: id of the event that is used when a model computation finishes.
    ON_SAVE_MODEL_SETTINGS: id of the event that is used when the model settings have been saved.

Functions:
