    SDF_API

    The Standard Datafeed (SDF) API provides an alternative method for users to request and retrieve SDF packages (schemas & bundles). This service is not a direct replacement and does not have 100% feature parity with the Loader. This API provides an alternative for users who are unable to utilize the Loader due to:  Unable to install 3rd party executables due to Corporate Security policies Unable to utilize the Loader due to limitations or restrictions with the environment used to consume Standard Datafeed Clients who are utilizing existing delivery method like FTP, who may want to use a more secured & modern solution This API allows users to retrieve SDF packages they have subscriptions for, going back to August 31, 2021. Additional parameters are available to filter requests to get the exact files users are looking for.   # noqa: E501
