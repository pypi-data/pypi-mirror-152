Description: # Enforce Newspaper Style with Flake
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Good code reads like a newspaper. Start with the highest abstraction, go to the details.
        This also enables to read the code without an editor.
        
        Quoting Robert C. Martin from his Clean Code book.
        
        “Think of a well-written newspaper article. You read it vertically. At the top, you expect a headline that will tell you what the story is about and allows you to decided whether it is something you want to read. The first paragraph gives you a synopsis of the whole story, hiding all the details while giving you the broad-brush concepts. As you continue downward, the details increase until you have all the dates, names, quotes, claims, and other minutiae. We would like a source file to be like a newspaper article.”
        
        In Python newspaper code should look like this.
        
        ```py
        def headline():
            text()
        
        def text():  # this needs to be defined after the usage.
            ...
        ```
        
        There hasn't been an automatic way in python to check for this. So here it is.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```py
        # install the flake8 extension for newspaper style
        pip3 install flake8-newspaper-style==1.2.3
        # then check your code
        flake8 --select=NEWS src  # here it restricts flake8 to newspaper style issues
        ```
