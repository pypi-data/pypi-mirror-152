# CheckSources

CheckSources is a preprocessor that checks the projectâ€™s `chapters` for missing and unmentioned files in the sources directory.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install foliantcontrib.checksources
```

## Usage

To enable the preprocessor, add `checksources` to `preprocessors` section in the project config:

```yaml
preprocessors:
    - checksources
```

You can add a list of unmentioned files that wouldn't throw warnings by `not_in_chapters` option:

```yaml
preprocessors:
    - checksources:
        not_in_chapters:
          - tags.md
```

It is useful if you don't need to add some files to the table of contents.
