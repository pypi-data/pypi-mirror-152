# HashedColls - hashed dict/list collections

## Simple Usage

```python3
from hashedcolls import HashedDict
from hashedcolls import HashedList

d = HashedDict
l = HashedList

my = d({d({1: 1}): 1, l([1, 2, 3]): 2, (1,): 3})
```

## How it works?

By default, `dict` and `list` Python 3 collections can not be used
as a key for a `dict`,  because they are mutable, thus are not `hashable`.  
But both `HashedDict` and `HashedList` contain `__hash__()` method implemented.  
How it works is that both of these classes have `Hashed` mixin included,
so they are able to use `Hashed.elements2hash()` function,
that basically returns `__hash__()` of all elements (`items()` in case of a `dict`).
