Importing Data into Cubeviz
***************************

There are two primary ways in which you can load your data into the Cubeviz
application. Cubeviz supports loading FITS files that can be parsed as 
:class:`~specutils.Spectrum1D` objects, in which case the application will
attempt to automatically parse the data into the viewers as described in 
:ref:`cubeviz-display-cubes`, including the 1D spectrum viewer. Data loaded
into Cubeviz MUST contain valid WCS keywords. For more information on how :class:`~specutils.Spectrum1D`
uses WCS, please go to the `Spectrum1D defining WCS section <https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spectrum1d.html#defining-wcs>`_.
To check if your FITS file contains valid WCS keywords, please use
`Astropy WCS validate <astropy.wcs.validate>`.
For an example on loading a cube with valid WCS keywords, please see the :ref:`cubeviz-import-api`
section below.

Importing data through the GUI
------------------------------

The first way you can load your data into the Cubeviz application is
by clicking the :guilabel:`Import` button at the top left of the application's 
user interface. This opens a dialogue where you can navigate your local
file system (single click to enter a folder) and select the path of a file 
that can be parsed as a :class:`~specutils.Spectrum1D`:

After clicking :guilabel:`Import`, the data file will be parsed and loaded into the 
application. A green success message will appear if the data import 
was successful. Afterward, the new data set can be found in the :guilabel:`Data` 
tab of each viewer's options menu as described in :ref:`cubeviz-selecting-data`.

Importing data via the API
--------------------------

Alternatively, if you are working in a coding environment like a Jupyter
notebook, you have access to the Cubeviz helper class API. Using this API,
you can load data into the application through code using the
:meth:`~jdaviz.core.helpers.ConfigHelper.load_data`
method, which takes as input either the name of a local file or a 
:class:`~specutils.Spectrum1D` object.::

    from jdaviz import Cubeviz
    cubeviz = Cubeviz()
    cubeviz.load_data("/Users/demouser/data/cube_file.fits")  # doctest: +SKIP
    cubeviz.app


If instead you would like to load data you have created within the notebook,
you can do the following::

    import numpy as np
    from astropy import units as u
    from astropy.wcs import WCS
    from specutils import Spectrum1D

    flux = np.arange(16).reshape((2, 2, 4)) * u.Jy
    wcs_dict = {"CTYPE1": "WAVE-LOG, "CTYPE2": "DEC--TAN", "CTYPE3": "RA---TAN",
                "CRVAL1": 4.622e-7, "CRVAL2": 27, "CRVAL3": 205,
                "CDELT1": 8e-11, "CDELT2": 0.0001, "CDELT3": -0.0001,
                "CRPIX1": 0, "CRPIX2": 0, "CRPIX3": 0}
    w = WCS(wcs_dict)

    cube = Spectrum1D(flux=flux, wcs=w)
    cubeviz.load_data(cube)
    cubeviz.app


To then extract your data from Cubeviz, please see the :ref:`cubeviz-notebook` section.
