en = "AshADha k1  bAji prabhu deshpANDe leading ~300 men died holding back Adil-shAhi african general siddi masud's 10k soldiers in a narrow pass while shivAji leading his 300 escaped to vishAlgad fort (having earlier let his barber take his place while escaping from another beseiged fort) and announced his safe arrival with a cannon-fire. PS: vishAlgad was already under siege by Bijapuri sardars Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi. it's a thrilling tale, akin to tale of the spartans holding back the persians at the narrow pass at Thermopylae."
