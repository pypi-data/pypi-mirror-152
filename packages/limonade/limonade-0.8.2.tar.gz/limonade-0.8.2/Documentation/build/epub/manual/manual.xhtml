<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What is Listmode</h2>
<p>Listmode is a library built around a single Data class and a lot of helper functions and classes.
The objective of Listmode is to simplify handling of listmode data from different sources. Ideally
all interaction with the library is either via the data class or the plotter function. Data can be
created by the streamer class. All details of the data are be defined by configuration of the
detector and the plot using configuration files written in json.</p>
<p>The data can be retrieved and histogrammed using powerful selection tools in the plot module.
These include selecting events by time interval, energy gates in (anti)coincident channels or
even gates in some extra data, such as coordinate information. Gates can also be defined as
polygonal 2d gates between any two pieces of data.</p>
<p>Listmode data tends to grow big. A single dataset is easily several million events long. Storing
all that data in memory is not efficient and in some cases not even possible. All data
operations in Listmode are processed in chunks. The data itself is stored in hard drive as
binary format files and only small chunk is read at a time. All data is immutable, in the sense
that the datafiles are never modified. Any change in data needs to be streamed into a new set of
datafiles.</p>

<h2>How to use Listmode</h2>
<p>The most important thing for user is to understand the structure and use of the configuration
files and the logic of the flow of data in the storage and plotting pipelines.</p>

<section id="what-is-data">
<h2>What is data?</h2>
<p>Data is timestamps. Timestamps are handled in a special way throughout the library. Every single
event has a timestamp. Timestamps are used to index the events and are the basis of the hashing
system used to speed up searches from long (multi-million event) datasets. Time interval of any
data operation needs to be defined before anything else. The start and stop indices in the time
slice are retrieved and the data loaded in chunks and set forward in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The data associated with the timestamp includes energy information for the channels that belong
to the event. At the moment the energy information is always present for every channel of the detector. Event can hold
other data in addition to energy information. For example coordinate information, signal rise time
value or a pile-up bit can be recorded by the detector and can be included as part of an event. This
extra data is always associated with a channel of the detector.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-flow-of-data">
<h2>The flow of data</h2>
<p>The most typical data operation is a plot. A plot is defined by plot configuration, a dictionary
or a file, which defines what plot class is instanced by the plotter function. Plot class loads
data in chunks, using the get_data_block method of the data class. It then makes the gate
selection defined in configuration using coincidence_mask function and feeds the selected data to
the filter which calculates a histogram of the data block. Plot class combines all the chunk
histograms into a master histogram which is then returned.</p>
<p>Normally all this is done automatically by the plotter function but can as well be done manually
using the data (and plot) class and selection function.</p>
