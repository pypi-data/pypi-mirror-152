        The Aging Report contains information about the total dollar

        You can specify viewing parameters for the aging report such as
        currency code and date bucket configuration. You can also view
        aging data for an entire account or a specific company.

        This information is recalculated when invoice data changes.
        After each invoice data change occurs, Lockstep queues up a
        calculation based on the current invoice data at that time. This
        information is calculated and persisted for each customer so
        that the report will be available quickly.

        `recalculate` option. Note that forcing a recalculation will
        slow your API response time.
