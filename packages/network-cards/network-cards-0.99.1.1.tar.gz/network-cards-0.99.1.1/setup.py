card for the Zachary Karate Club\' width=\'600\'>\n</p>\n\nThe first panel provides an overall summary of the network, the second summarizes the structure of the network (size, density, connectivity), and the third panel provides additional meta-information, what metadata are associated with nodes and links, how were the data gathered, and so forth.\n\nNetwork cards are intended to be _concise, readable and flexible_, allowing researchers across fields to quickly read and understand studies involving network datasets. \nWe believe that a standard representation is crucial to ensuring that key information associated with network data remains available.\n\nThis repository provides [templates](templates/) and a [Python package](#install) to create, update, and export network cards.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Example](#example)\n* [Install](#install)\n\t- [Requirements](#requirements)\n* [Citation](#citation)\n* [License](#License)\n\n\n\n\n## Example\n\n`Network Cards` provides [fill-in templates](templates/) but you can also generate and save a card programmatically. \nHere\'s Python code where we load a network from a file and compute the basic card: \n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport network_cards as nc\n\nG = nx.read_edgelist("karate_club.edgelist")\n\ncard = nc.NetworkCard(G)\nprint(card)\n```\nThis gives:\n\n```text\n                   Name                       \n                   Kind Undirected, unweighted\n              Nodes are                       \n              Links are                       \n         Considerations                       \n        Number of nodes                     34\n        Number of links                     78\n               Degree^1        4.58824 [1, 17]\n             Clustering                  0.571\n              Connected                    Yes\n               Diameter                      5\n Assortativity (degree)                 -0.476\n          Node metadata                       \n          Link metadata                       \n       Date of creation                       \nData generating process                       \n                 Ethics                       \n                Funding                       \n               Citation                       \n\n^1: Distributions summarized with average [min, max].\n```\n\nUnfortunately, few of the important definitions, details or meta-information are computable, so\nmost of the fields outside the structure panel are blank.\nLet\'s use `update_*` methods to populate the remaining fields ourselves:\n\n```python\ncard.update_overall("Name", "Zachary Karate Club")\ncard.update_overall("Nodes are", "Members of club at US university")\ncard.update_overall("Links are", "Members consistently interacted outside club")\ncard.update_overall("Considerations", "Heavily used as an example network")\n\ncard.update_metainfo({\n    "Node metadata":           "None",\n    "Link metadata":           "None (original study included eight interaction contexts)",\n    "Date of creation":        "1977",\n    "Data generating process": "Direct observation of club members during period 1970-72",\n    "Funding":                 "None",\n    "Citation":                "Zachary (1977)"\n    })\n```\n\nWe used `card.update_overall()` and `card.update_metainfo()` to insert entries into the previous card. \nEntries can be updated one at a time (like we did when updating the overall panel) or a dictionary can be passed to update multiple entries at once.\n\nNow, print the revised card with `print(card)`:\n\n```text\n                   Name                                       Zachary Karate Club\n                   Kind                                    Undirected,
