DEFAULT ANALYSIS

The default analysis operation performs the following functions:
    - Skeleton Dilation (Default Dilation is 10)
    - Cropping of the image to the length/size/volume of the skeleton
    - Median filter with a cube width of 3
    - Background subtraction using a gaussion blur of strength 7.
    - Adaptive Histogram Equalization: This consists of using scikit image's adaptive histogram equalization option. It is then multipled to the background subtracted image to give the final contrast.
    - Multiotsu mask at 2 classes (there are presumed only 2 classes, background and regions of interest)
    - Default morphology: Dilation morphology and then closing morphology
    - Labels are added to the image.
