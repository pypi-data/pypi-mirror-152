## üìö Installation

For quick installation of the contract `ABIs`:

### Javascript/Typescript
```bash
npm install @oceanprotocol/contracts
```
### Python
```bash
pip3 install ocean-contracts
```
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
By default, Python does not support importing `json` files directly, so it is recommended to use `json-sempai` package in order to automatically importing `ABIs/json` artifacts.
```
pip3 install json-sempai
# install the ocean-contracts package.
```
```python
from jsonsempai import magic
from artifacts import address
```


## Overview

## üèÑ Quickstart

### Features 

- Base IP is now represented by an NFT, from which a datapublisher can create multiple ERC20s representing different type of access for the same dataset. (Link to NFT blog)

- An automated Datatoken Staking and Vesting contract helps with the initial DTs distribution and price stability. Goodbye rug pulls! More info on how it works: (Link to SideStaking blog)

- Help Ocean Community Monetize: there's a swap fee for the Ocean Community, if Ocean or allied tokens are the basetoken in a pool, Ocean Community will receive 0.1% swap fee, otherwhise it will be 0.2%. More details here: (Link to blog post on Ocean community monetization)


#### Flexibility

- Introduce an advanced Fee Structure both for Market and Provider runners. (add link to fee post/docs when available)

- Roles Administration: there are now multiple roles for a more flexible administation both at NFT and ERC20 levels

- Key-value store in the NFT contract : NFT contract can be used to store custom key-value pairs (ERC725Y standard)

- Multiple NFT template support: the Factory can deploy different types of NFT templates

- Multiple datatoken template support: the Factory can deploy different types of Datatoken templates

The [ocean.js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) and [ocean.py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) libraries wrap `contracts` in JavaScript and Python respectively. They each have quickstart guides.


## ü¶ë Development and Testing

Run hardhat in a new terminal:
```bash
export ALCHEMY_URL="https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/XXXXXXXX"
npm install
npx hardhat node
```

Open a new terminal to run the tests:

```bash
export ALCHEMY_URL="https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/XXXXXXXX"

npm run test:full
# same thing, but with coverage reporting
npm run test:full:cover
```

### Unit Tests

You can execute just unit tests with:

```bash
npm run test:unit

```

### Flow Tests

You can execute just flow tests with:

```bash
npm run test:flow

```

## Known issues
 Vesting:
  - when (vestingAmount/vestedBlocks) is a Periodic number, there‚Äôs a rounding issue of 1 wei. So if a publisher will call it once per day, over a period of 2 years, you may have a rounding error combined of 730 Weis. That is a neglectable amount.
