## OpenIRIS API

A simple API for [openiris.io](openiris.io). OpenIRIS is a free platform permitting the publishing and management of resources form microscopy units.

This API was developped as part of a France BioImaging project and is offered for use to anyone in the scientific community.

At the moment, there is no REST API published by the site's developpers. This package aims to provide a functional solution that permits PROVIDER ardministration to download data directly from the website's backend.

Currently in Alpha, more features are scheduled to be added alongside a complete documentation.
