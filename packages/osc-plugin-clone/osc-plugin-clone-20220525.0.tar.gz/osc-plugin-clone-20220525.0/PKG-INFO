osc clone
=========

This command creates a clone of an OBS project, copying all packages,
metadata and project configuration. If necessary, it updates the
metadata to match the new project name. For this to work correctly,
it assumes the project's name is `<distro>:<release>:<component>`:

    $ osc clone debian:jessie:main debian:stretch:main

osc fork
========

This command clones a forest of OBS projects corresponding to a single
distribution with multiple components. It copies projects, adjusting
their dependencies to match the new project names.

For this to work correctly, it assumes the project names are
`<distro>:<release>:<component>`:

     $ osc fork debian:jessie debian:stretch

Installation
============

To install osc-plugin-clone, type:

    ./setup.py install

At the moment, installing to a user's home directory isn't supported.
