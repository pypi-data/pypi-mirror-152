  The first release of PhyCV is available!


## Introduction
PhyCV is a Physics-inspired Computer Vision Python library. PhyCV has a new class of computer vision algorithms that emulates the propagation of light through a physical medium with natural and engineered diffractive properties followed by coherent detection. Unlike traditional algorithms that are a sequence of hand-crafted empirical rules, physics-inspired algorithms leverage physical laws of nature as blueprints. These algorithms can, in principle, be implemented in real physical devices for fast and efficient computation.  Currently, PhyCV includes Phase-Stretch Transform (PST) and Phase-Stretch Adaptive Gradient-field Extractor (PAGE). Each algorthm has CPU and GPU versions.
