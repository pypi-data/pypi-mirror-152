# PotreePublisher
Small CLI to quickly publish a single LAS file or a whole folder to a Potree server.


## Prerequisites
It is assumed that you have a **Potree server** installed on your machine.
<details>
<summary>Expand for instructions if you don't :wink:</summary>

1. Clone the potree repository: `git clone https://github.com/potree/potree`

2. Make sure you have the Node Package Manager (npm) installed (usually delivered with node.js).

3. Inside potree's repository, run `npm install`. It will install dependencies (specified in package.json) and create a build in ./build/potree.

4. Move the potree folder to you favorite http server.

5. Make sure you spot the location where you want to:
 + store the point clouds
 + store the viewer html files

6. You're good to go!
