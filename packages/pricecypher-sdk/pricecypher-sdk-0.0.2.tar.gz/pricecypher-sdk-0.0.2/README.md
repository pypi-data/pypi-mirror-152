# PriceCypher Python SDK

Python wrapper around the different PriceCypher APIs.

## Usage
### Installation
TODO

### Dataset SDK
```python
from pricecypher import Datasets

datasets = Datasets(BEARER_TOKEN)

datasets.index()
datasets.get_meta(DATASET_ID)
datasets.get_scopes(DATASET_ID)
datasets.get_scope_values(DATASET_ID, SCOPE_ID)
datasets.get_transaction_summary(DATASET_ID)

columns = [
    {'name_dataset': 'cust_group', 'filter': ['Big', 'Small'], 'key': 'group'},
    {'representation': 'cost_price', 'aggregate': 'sum', 'key': 'cost_price'}
]
datasets.get_transactions(DATASET_ID, AGGREGATE, columns)
```

## Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
* Python >= 3.9

### Setup
The `endpoints` module models the different PriceCypher API endpoints. Each file represents a different API and the
contents of each file are structured into the different endpoints that are provided by the API.
Similarly, each file in the `models` module defines the models that are provided by the different APIs.

The SDK that this package provides is contained in the top-level package contents.
