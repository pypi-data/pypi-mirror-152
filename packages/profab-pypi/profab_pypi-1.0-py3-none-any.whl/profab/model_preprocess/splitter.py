    Description:
        This function splits X and y randomly to train, test and validation
        sets according to ratio value
        
    Parameters:
        X: default = None, feature matrix. If X_pos and X_neg are not None,
            it has to stay None.
        y: default = None, label Matrix. If X_pos and X_neg are not None,
            it has to stay None. If X is defined, it cannot stay None.
        X_pos: default = None, positive set feature matrix. If X is defined,
                it has to stay None
        X_neg: default = None, negative set feature matrix. If X is defined,
                it has to stay None.
        ratio, type = {float,list}, (default = 0.2), is used to split the 
        data according given value(s). If ratio = a (flaot), then test will 
        be a% of total data size.If ratio = [a,b] where a and b are 
        in (0,1), train, test and validation sets are formed according to 
        them. If a = 0.2 and b = 0.1, train fraction is 0.7, test fraction 
        is 0.2 and validation fraction is 0.1 of all dataset size.
