The NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) Prognostics Models Package (prog_models) is a Python framework for defining, building, using, and testing models for prognostics (computation of remaining useful life) of engineering systems. It also provides a set of prognostics models for select components developed within this framework, suitable for use in prognostics applications for these components and can be used in conjunction with the Prognostics Algorithms Library to perform research in prognostics methods. 

The Prognostics Algorithms Package was developed by researchers of the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) and `Diagnostics & Prognostics Group <https://www.nasa.gov/content/diagnostics-prognostics>`__.

If you are new to this package, see `<getting_started.html>`__.
