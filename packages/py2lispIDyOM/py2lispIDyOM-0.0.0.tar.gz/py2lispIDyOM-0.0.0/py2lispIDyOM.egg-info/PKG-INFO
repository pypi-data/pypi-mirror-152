- Data preprocessing
- Visualizing IDyOM outputs

Please have a look at the [tutorial](tutorials/), which guides you through all three basic functionalities of through an
example.

Note: I tried to make the code accessible and provide some examples in the tutorials for getting started smoothly. But
there is still lots of room for better documentation and testing. Please contact me if you have any questions or
