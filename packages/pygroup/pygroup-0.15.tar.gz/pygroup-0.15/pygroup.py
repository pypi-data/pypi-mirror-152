    ''' Some Important Instructions of the Class Group
    
        1. About group intialization
       
            sets the elements in the group from a set together with a binary operation,
            the identity can be specially indicated. You can also set the general form
            of the elements in the group and the inverse form of them.
            The operation could be a function, in which to perform the steps
            you want to deal with elements in the group.
            And elements can also be a list of functions or any class objects.
            
        2. Some Standard Operators
        
            Below are some special cases that you can simplify the operation:
            if operation is '+' or 'add': translate as add(x, y)
            if operation is '-' or 'subtract': translate as sub(x, y)
            if operation is '*' or 'mult': translate as mult(x, y)
            if operation is '/' or 'divide': translate as divide(x, y)
            if you want operation to be like '+ mod 8' or '* mod 17',
            then just set the operation as 'mod('+', 8)' or 'mod('*', 17)'.
            P.S. actually, lambda is a easy way to set the operation as what you
            want to do, for example: set the operation as "lambda x, y: x*y"
            means multiply each two elements in the group, and "lambda x, y: x+y"
            is for additive case. For relatively simple operations, using lambda will be a chill.
        
        3. Composition Cases
        
            for permutations or D3 for example, you can set the operation as 'composition',
            and make every element of the group is a function (in dihedral group case)
            or a permutation object (in permutation group case).
            and function elements is in much more cases of groups with compositions,
            you can design your own functions that dealing with your group and set them as elements
            permutation is a class implemented for permutation groups together with their calculations
            and evaluations. For Dihedral groups Dn, you can set obj = D(n), here I provide
            a function D(n) which returns a polygon object Dn with group elements (for more
            information, please check the class description of polygon in this file),
            and the element of the group will be automatically set to the group elements of Dn.
            When the program receives these functions, it will check the first carrying variables
            of each function, (so you should keep every funtion with a same first variable)
            and generate a dynamic polygon object which data can be changed during every operation
            from function elements. in D4 you can also add H(4) which stands for horizontal flip,
            and in D5, D6, ..., they are all following the same roles of implementation.
            
        4. General Form and Inverse Form
        
            general form and inverse form is not required as you set the element to be something,
            but if you want to set conditions that if an element is a valid element inside the
            group, you can make a function that returns True if the element satisfies
            some conditions else return False, for multiple conditions,
            you can either make them all inside a function or make
            a list contains all of the functions that checks a condition for each function.
            Note that if you keep the element as None (if you do not set element, the default is None),
            a general form is required, because in this case this group is considered to be an infinite group.
        
        5. Add an element to the group
        
            To add an element to a group, the program will first check if the element
            is valid, otherwise return warning; cannot add this element because it does not
            satisfies the conditions of the group. To get inverse of each element in the group,
            just simply go through every element in the group, do the operation and see if the
            result is equal to the identity.
        
        6. Object in the group
        
            with special kinds of group, sometimes an object is required, as an example, for dihedral groups,
            when the elements are settled for Dn, the program will set the obj to a polygon object.
            you can also set object by yourself fitting with elements and group operations.
            you can also add some infomartion for this map that describes the types and
            attributes of this group, and how this group works, etc.
        
        7. Infinite Group Case
            For infinite groups, which means the number of elements are infinite,
            you can leave the elment as None, but in this case this class requires
            a general form which holds all of the conditions that the elements
            in this group must satisfy. The general form could be a function or
            a list of functions that returns True or False.
            When the program want to show if the group is finite or infinite,
            it will check if the type of elements is None, if so then this group
            is infinite, otherwise is finite.
            there is a method called get_element(m, n) in this class that could
            take the element subset from a range which satisfies the conditions of
            the group, which is only applicable for infinite group, which means
            the elements of the group should be None. So at any time you want to
            change a finite group to an infinite group, just set the element to None,
            and then make sure you have set the general form for this group.
            
        8. Inverse
        
            Inverse is a function which is the reverse-form of operation function.
            If this is an infinite group (i.e. the element is a function or None),
            inverse should be settled, otherwise when use inverse(g) to find an inverse
            of an element g in the group, the program will return a warning.

        '''Choose an abstract element from a class object which represents
        the general form of the group, this function is a bit awkward to understand
        what had how it is doing, here I will give some examples.
        Now let's say we have a group GL(2,R) (this is a group with 2x2 matrices and
        every matrix's determinant is not equal to 0). This group is of course
        an infinite group, and it is easy to set conditions for this group,
        namely, a matrix with both of its row number and column number is 2 and
        has a non-zero determinant. But when we are trying to prove it is a group,
        some of the conditions is hard to justify without setting a representative
        element of this group beforehand. Usually, for all cases of an infinite group,
        setting a representative element requires a polynomial object that labels
        with the attributes of the elements in the group, and satisfies the conditions
        of the group. For the group GL(2,R), this function will return a 2x2 matrix
        (we can call it A) with elements a, b, c, d (a,b in the first row and c,d in the second row)
        and det(A) = ad - bc != 0, here we will be using inequality class which is also
        written by me in the polynomial module (and this module has an equation parameter too)
        When we use is_group function to prove that GL(2,R) is a group, or using
        is_cyclic, is_abelian and so on to prove some groups is of some special kinds
        of groups, this function will be used very frequently.
