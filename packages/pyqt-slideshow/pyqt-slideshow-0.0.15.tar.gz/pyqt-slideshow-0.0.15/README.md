This widget mainly consists of three child widget.

* View
* Navigation button widget - buttons on the both sides of the view
* Bottom button widget - buttons at the bottom

You can set the image files to show with `setFilenames`.

You can watch previous/next image by clicking the navigation button or nth image file by clicking the buttons at the bottom.

Image is automatically changed by internal timer. It is set to 5000 milliseconds by default.

## Method Overview
* `setFilenames(filenames: list)` - give the image files. You have to call this one time only so far.
* `setInterval(milliseconds: int)` - set the image change interval
* `setNavigationButtonVisible(f: bool)` - set the navigation button's visibility(which also decides that you use it or not)
* `setBottomButtonVisible(f: bool)` - set the bottom button's visibility(which also decides that you use it or not)

## Example

I'm still working on SvgButton's style. You can see the <, > buttons in the picture. Those things are SvgButton. 

It is kinda ugly looking and could be hard to see depending on the photo. So i will definitely change the style.

Note: Don't play the last game on the list.
