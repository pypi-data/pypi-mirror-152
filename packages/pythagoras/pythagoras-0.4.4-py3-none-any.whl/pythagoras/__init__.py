"""Pythagoras aims to democratize access to distributed serverless compute.

We make it simple and inexpensive to create, deploy and run
cloud-scale massively parallel algorithms from within local
Python scripts and notebooks. Pythagoras makes data scientists' lives easier,
while allowing them to solve more complex problems
in a shorter time with smaller budgets.
