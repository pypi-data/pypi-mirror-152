# _DBT_PKG_NAME_
A dbt package generated by [reflekt](https://github.com/GClunies/reflekt). This package includes sources, models, and docs based on the events defined in the `_PLAN_NAME_` reflekt tracking plan. This package can be used as a foundation for further modeling.

To use the models in this package, reference it in the `packages.yml` of your dbt project. It is assumed this package is version controlled inside a repo so it can be referenced like:

```yml
# packages.yml
- git: "https://github.com/path/to/your/repo.git"  # git URL
    revision: 0.1.0  # tag, branch name, or 40-char commit hash
```

See the [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/package-management/) for further details on using dbt packages.
