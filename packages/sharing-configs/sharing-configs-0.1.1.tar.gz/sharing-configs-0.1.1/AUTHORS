The Sharing Configs Library was created in conjunction with the Sharing Configs API
by Maykin Media in order to share configurations among different projects.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made the components that 
much better:

    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Tatjana Rietveldt <tatjana@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Demodam for their active support in creating this application.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
