The ``Snakefile``
=================

Every ``showyourwork`` article repository is instantiated with a blank ``Snakefile``
at the repository root. This file gets included in the main (build) step of the
workflow, and may thus be used to define custom rules or to run custom ``python``
code during the workflow. Read more about these kinds of files at the
`Snakemake documentation <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html>`_.
