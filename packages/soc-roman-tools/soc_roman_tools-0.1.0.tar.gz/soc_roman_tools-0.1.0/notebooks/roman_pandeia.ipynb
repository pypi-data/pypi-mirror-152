    "# Roman ETC Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is to demonstrate options for streamlining the use of the exposure-time calculator (ETC) written for the *Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope* (Roman) called ```pandeia``` (see [pandeia homepage](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview/jwst-etc-pandeia-engine-tutorial)).  The primary code ```pandeia.engine``` primarly takes two inputs: (1) an instrumental set up and (2) a scene of astronomical sources and produces an output dictionary (see [pandeia reports](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview/jwst-etc-pandeia-engine-tutorial/pandeia-reports)). Importantly, the output dictionary contains the best estimate for several key predictions: the signal-to-noise (S/N), exposure time, and expected flux (in e-/s).  However, some users may find that computing S/N is not quite what is needed, but rather would prefer to tweak the properties of the instrumental set up and/or astronomical scene for a specified S/N.\n",

    "## Primary Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As eluded to above, there are three relevant \"quantities\" in an ETC (something that emulates exposure time, source brightness, and signal-to-noise), and the point of this suite is to compute any one of these quantities, given the other two.  As such, there are primarily three functions that users will likely use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```soc_roman_tools.utilities.pandeia_notebook.compute_sn```\n",
    "2. ```soc_roman_tools.utilities.pandeia_notebook.compute_mag```\n",
    "3. ```soc_roman_tools.utilities.pandeia_notebook.compute_nexp```\n",
    "\n",
    "**An Aside on Roman/WFI Exposure Times:** The Roman/WFI employs a non-destrcutive, up-the-ramp sampling method, wherein the exposure time is determined from the combination of the readout pattern and number of groups and exposures.  For the purposes of this notebook, we hold the number of groups defaulted as ```ngroup```=10, therefore the number of exposures ```nexp``` is the tunable parameter that govens exposure time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to every function are largely the same, parameter(s) governing the instrumental setup and astronomical sources.  Full details of these functions are included in the ```soc_roman_tools.utilities.pandeia_notebook.py``` file, but in brief they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instrumental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **background:** low sky background, see [Pandeia Backgrounds](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview/jwst-etc-pandeia-engine-tutorial/pandeia-backgrounds) for more information on the background models and fiducial levels.\n",
    "- **measurement aperture:** $r=0.2''$ with sky annulus of $0.6''<r<0.8''$\n",
    "- **detector readout:** the current expectation for running the Roman/WFI is that there will be a single integration (hence ```nint```=1), and the user is free to alter the value of ```ngroup``` (but is defaulted to 10).  However, one should not reduce ```ngroup``` below ~4 as the assumptions on the first-frame property and readnoise become dominant.  For more information on the detector readouts, please see the [Understanding Exposure Times](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/understanding-exposure-times) article in the JWST documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the key tunable parameter is taken to be ```nexp```, which must always be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Astronomical Scene\n",
    "\n",
    "- **spatial morphology:** point source\n",
    "- **spectral morphology:** $f_\\nu = $ constant\n",
    "- **magnitude system:** AB \n",
    "\n",
    "With that, there is only one tunable parameter: the normalization constant of the spectrum, which is set as an AB magnitude normalization.  Therefore, the wavelength and \"type\" of normalization does not matter, but are defaulted as 2.0 $\\mu$m and ```at_lambda```, respectively.  Therefore, the AB magnitude as ```norm_flux``` is the parameter that governs the astronomical scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the primary three functions returns two quantities: (1) the quantity of interest and (2) the output dictionary from ```pandeia.engine``` (the details of this dictionary are given in the [pandeia reports](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview/jwst-etc-pandeia-engine-tutorial/pandeia-reports)).  This notebook will not delve into this dictionary, but rather use only the quantities of interest.\n"
