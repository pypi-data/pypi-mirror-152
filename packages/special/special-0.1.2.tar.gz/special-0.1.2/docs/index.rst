Welcome to the `special` documentation
======================================

``special`` is a package for the SPEctral Characterization of directly ImAged Low-mass companions. While some tools are specific to the characterisation of directly imaged (sub-)stellar companions, the main features of ``special`` can also be used in a more general way for the characterisation of any object with a measured spectrum, provided an input model or template grid.
