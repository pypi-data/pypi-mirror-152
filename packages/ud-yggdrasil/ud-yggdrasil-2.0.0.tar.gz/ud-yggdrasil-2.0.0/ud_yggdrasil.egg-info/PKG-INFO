Description: # Yggdrasil
        #### Concept
        The yggdrasil library is meant to facilitate the distribution of scripts into production through the definition of apps.
        Conceptually, each app is defined as:
        - Name: Characterises the app to be installed / uninstalled
        - Source code: Source code of the project that must be accessed
        - Entry points: Entry points of the project
        - Virtual environment: environment to run the app within
        
        Through its API, yggdrasil gives your means to seamlessly switch between several virtual environments while having an 
        easy way to call your home-made scripts from the command line.
        
        #### Getting started
        Before using the tool to create apps, yggdrasil needs an initial set up.
        First, install the package (either from PyPI or from Github):
        ```commandline
        pip install ud-yggdrasil
        pip install git+https://www.github.com/um-ed/ud-yggdrasil.git
        ```
        
        Then, create the base folder structure to install yggdrasil into:
        ```shell script
        yggdrasil seed
        ```
        If a path is set up as environment variable (*YGGDRASIL_ROOT*), the folders structure will be created there.
        If not, it will be created under the user's *Documents* folder.
        To make each app easily callable from the command line, it's also recommended to add the 
        *Yggdrasil\Scripts* full path to the *Path* environment variable.
        
        That's it, you're ready to create your first application!
        
        #### Applications requirements
        The definition of apps is done through the settings.yaml file (under Yggdrasil\settings). The library gives the possibility
        to either install apps that are only stored locally (local apps hereafter) or hosted online in a git repository (web apps
        hereafter).
        The settings file is automatically created when running *seed*, already prefilled with dummy examples for local & web setups.
        If in doubt / altered locally, it can also be found under this repository (yggdrasil\data\template_settings.yaml).
        To be able to create an application, the core project will also need to define:
        - A requirements.txt file with the project's dependencies, located at the source of the package / project directory
        - For web-based apps, the project will need to define entry points in the setup.py file
        
        #### Yggdrasil commands
        Yggdrasil can be called either from shell or from python. From shell:
        ```commandline
        yggdrasil seed # Creates a seed for yggdrasil
        yggdrasil create app_name # Installs an app for the given name
        yggdrasil remove app_name # Uninstalls an app for the given name
        yggdrasil show app_name # Show information related to the app name provided
        ```
        *(Further parametrisation available, details with -h)*
        
        From python:
        ```python
        import yggdrasil as ygg
        ygg.seed() # Creates a seed for yggdrasil
        ygg.create("app_name") # Installs an app for the given name
        ygg.remove("app_name") # Uninstalls an app for the given name
        ygg.show("app_name") # Show information related to the app name provided
        ```
        
        After an application is installed through yggdrasil (and provided the yggdrasil scripts' path was added
        to the *Path* environment variable), you will be able to call the project's entry points
        directly from the command line:
        ```commandline
        app_name
        ```
