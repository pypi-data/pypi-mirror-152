**I  have released one draft version of a GUI version to make the usage for those non-coding people that want a one click easy solution.  It's been tested by about 5 friends. You can check it out if you sponsor me. You can get the exe version on Windows**

[Get the early bird version. Please sponsor me here](https://github.com/sponsors/wanghaisheng)

or click any link you find in the repo

![Tiktoka Uploader GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanghaisheng/youtube-auto-upload/master/assets/autovideopublisher_cCU22EfevT.png)


A cross platform GUI is being developed.

In the future I plan to add more features like invisible watermark to protect your copyright from theft and cross platform publish that you may post videos not only on Youtube.


## video demo 

[English version detailed intro and demo ](https://youtu.be/Xh-Dmm1POBo)

------

## features included in the GUI version

### no limit of video counts
you may got hundreds of historical videos or prepare 200+ viedo for new product.

1000+ is possible especially for backup usage as private 

###  you don't have to edit all metadata one by one
description combine from prefix, suffix and video filename
tags combine from preferred tags and ai based generated topic related tags
pulish time can automatically set without any effort

### auto generate thumbnail from video hightlight

you can using these as startpoint to add overlay text to make it more clickbait to get traffic

### auto add Free copyright music 

some music is the secret weapon to traffic, you need dig it by yourself.and also not to share with others

### invisible watermark

at some day if you got viral  someone will steal your content to repost over other platform, cut off your logo or other visible watermark,with this invisible/hidden watermark technology, you can hardless lost the battle

### multi-account and multi-channel under one account

as a newbie you will not want to be limited to only using one account. It will save your time to success

### auto set schedule time to public for each video
bulk publish.
it seems no other lib supports this feature yet

### video upload in batch

all you need is choose the video directory


### Installed on PC, access from PC and mobile 


------

This project aims to automate the upload process for YouTube Videos. Since videos can only be publicly uploaded through the YouTube Data API by using a Google Workspaces Account (not free!), I decided to figure out a headless uploader using Selenium and Playwright. This approach also bypasses API restrictions (e.g. Rate Limits/Endcards can't be set through the API).There are tons of library existing  but not for me .

AS a code dummy, I do accept any advice because my only purpose is to get things working

**if you are a selenium guy, pls check  main branch, if not just use this playwright branch.**

## rewrite it with microsoft playwright

1. speed is much  faster than selenium version

2. you don't have to worry about browser driver any more 

3. more like category setting, auto publish date, subtitle upload etc are considered


## USAGE
if there's anything you don't understand, just google it first, for example firefox profile

1. Download the lastest Firefox, open a new tab and insert:    
```
about:profiles
```
一般来说 一个youtube帐号要新建一个profile
文件夹可以选在assets下

2.install the Firefox addon, **Cookie-Editor**，mannually login into your Youtube channel，click the profile icon, choose English language, export and save as cookie.json 



3. if you want to modify source code, use as a library for your project, pls do    
```

git clone https://github.com/wanghaisheng/youtube-auto-upload

pip install -r requirements.txt

python onefile-example.py 

all codes under **ytb_up**, twist them as you wish

```

4. There is a selenium and playwright version, choose the one you like
switch branches to find it

5. use existing without modification as a lib
```
pip install ytb-up
```

6. to get started edit onefile-example.py and enter in your CHANNEL_COOKIES path, videopath etc. Then run the file.

# features YOU MAY NEED

# 1. proxy support
auto detect whether need a proxy 

# 2. cookie support
for those with multiple channels under the one Google account


pls check 
https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/12616

manually change all occurances of no_restriction in your cookies.json file to

>        "sameSite": "None",


# 3. schedule time publish

you can explictly specify a date and time for each video or you can set publish policy and daily public count, for example, daily count is 4, you got 5 videos, then first 4 will be published 1 day after the upload date, the other 1 will be 2 days after the upload date

# 4. fix Google account verify

if auto verify is not working, you need to manually input verification code into your browser
